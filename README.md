SOFTWARE:

    main_deblurring_problem.m       Generate synthetic problem 
                                    Run msHyBR
                                    Run 2 steps process: forward_selection + geostatistical_inversion
                                    (forward selection is done using the 'BIC', 'AIC' and 'F-test' methods)
                                    Run 2 steps process: exhaustive_selection + geostatistical_inversion
                                    (exhaustive selection is done using the 'BIC' and 'AIC' methods)
                                    
    plots_deblurring_problem.m      Plot the results from 'main_deblurring_problem.m'including:
                                    - Basis vectors in the problem formulation
                                    - Solutions Reconstrucions
                                    - Coefficient Reconstrucions
                                    - Relative error norm histories
                                    - Print out of 'Binary classifier metrics'
                                    Save figures in the folder 'Figures'
                                    * Requieres running 'main_deblurring_problem.m'
