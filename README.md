SOFTWARE LANGUAGE:

       MATLAB 9.14 (R2023a)
       For those without access to MATLAB, Octave provides an alternative platform.  
       Note that these codes have not been tested in Octave. 



## SOFTWARE and DATA SETS

The MainDrivers require the following package:

    "IR tools: A MATLAB Package of Iterative Regularization"
    by Silvia Gazzola, Per Christian Hansen and James G. Nagy
    https://github.com/jnagy1/IRtools.git

and require the data sets:
    
    "Geostatistical inverse modeling with large atmospheric data: 
    data files for a case study from OCO-2"
    by Scot M. Miller, Arvind K. Saibaba, Michael E. Trudeau, 
    Marikate E. Mountain, and Arlyn E. Andrews
    https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3241466

     - Put the matrix 'H_all_OCO2.mat' in the folder "Data/" 


For Experiment 1 in [1], the main drivers include:
    
    main_deblurring_problem.m       Generate synthetic problem 
                                    Run msHyBR
                                    Run 2 steps process: forward_selection + geostatistical_inversion
                                    (forward selection is done using the 'BIC', 'AIC' and 'F-test' methods)
                                    Run 2 steps process: exhaustive_selection + geostatistical_inversion
                                    (exhaustive selection is done using the 'BIC' and 'AIC' methods)
                                    
    plots_deblurring_problem.m      Plot the results from 'main_deblurring_problem.m' including:
                                    - Basis vectors in the problem formulation
                                    - Solutions Reconstructions
                                    - Coefficient Reconstructions
                                    - Relative error norm histories
                                    - Print out of 'Binary classifier metrics'
                                    Save figures in the folder 'Figures'
                                    * Requires running 'main_deblurring_problem.m'

To run these codes, open a MATLAB command window, and type 
     
     >> main_deblurring_problem [press enter/return]
     >> plots_deblurring_problem [press enter/return]



For Experiment 2 in [1], the main drivers include:

    generate_synthetic_data.m		Generate synthetic data with the same distribution than the one corresponding to
						Experiment 2 in [1]. (Note that these do not generate fully reproducible codes)
   
    main_atmospheric_synthetic_problem.m	Load synthetic problem 
						(Optionally, generate new synthetic data instead running 'generate_synthetic_data.m')
                                    	Run msHyBR
                                    	Run 2 steps process: forward_selection + geostatistical_inversion
                                    	(forward selection is done using the 'BIC' method)
                                    
    plots_atmospheric_synthetic_problem.m       Plot the results from 'main_atmospheric_synthetic_problem.m' including:
                                    		- Representation of the donation model in the problem formulation
                                    		- Solutions Reconstructions
                                   			- Coefficient Reconstructions

                                    		- Representation of the selected basis vectors
                                    		Save figures in the folder 'Figures'
                                    		* Requires running 'main_atmospheric_synthetic_problem.m'

To run these codes, open a MATLAB command window, and type 
     
     >> main_atmospheric_synthetic_problem [press enter/return]
